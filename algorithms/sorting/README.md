# Sorting Algorithms

This section contains sorting algorithms implemented in JavaScript.

## Bubble Sort:
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- **Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²) in the worst and average case, O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (in-place sorting).
- **When to use**: Useful for small datasets or when teaching sorting algorithms, but not efficient for large datasets.
