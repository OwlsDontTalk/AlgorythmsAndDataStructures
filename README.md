# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

This repository contains various data structures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript. Each data structure and algorithm is accompanied by:
- **Description**: Explanation of what it is and when to use it.
- **Use Cases**: Practical scenarios where it's useful.
- **Implementation**: Code examples with JavaScript.

## Structure

### Data Structures:
- [Arrays](./data-structures/arrays/README.md)
- [Linked Lists](./data-structures/linked-lists/README.md)
- [Stacks](./data-structures/stacks/README.md)
- [Queue](./data-structures/queue/README.md)
- [Hash Tables](./data-structures/hash-tables/README.md)
- [Stacks](./data-structures/stacks/README.md)

### Algorithms:
- [Algorithms](./algorithms/README.md)

Each folder contains:
- A `README.md` with detailed information about the data structure or algorithm.
- A JavaScript file with the implementation.
