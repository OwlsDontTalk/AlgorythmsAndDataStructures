# Stack

## Description:
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. The last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

## Key Points:
- Follows the **LIFO** (Last In, First Out) principle.
- Common operations include:
  - **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
  - **Pop**: Remove the top element from the stack.
  - **Peek**: Look at the top element without removing it.
  - **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.

### Time Complexity:
- **Access**: O(n)
- **Search**: O(n)
- **Insertion (push)**: O(1)
- **Deletion (pop)**: O(1)

## When to use:
- When you need to manage data in LIFO order, such as in backtracking or undo operations.
- Useful for evaluating expressions, managing function calls, and implementing depth-first search.
